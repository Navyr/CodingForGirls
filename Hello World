The Hello world program prints "Hello, World!" on the screen when the program is run.

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }

In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class. This line declares a class named `Main`, which is `public`, that means that any other class can access it. This is not important for now, so don't worry. For now, we'll just write our code in a class called Main, and talk about objects later on.

A public class must be declared inside a file with the same name.

The next line is:

    public static void main(String[] args) {

Void simply means that this method doesn't return any value.
The arguments we get inside the method form an array of strings.

    System.out.println("Hello, World!");

out represents the output of your program (stdout).
println is used to print a line.

Exercise
--------

Print "Hello, World!" to the console.

`System.out.println("Hello, World!");`
